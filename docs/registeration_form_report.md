### üîç Registration Form Report Overview

This document overlays the issues found in the registration form implementation. It provides a
detailed analysis of the problems, their causes, and potential solutions.

## üö® Issues Identified

1. **Lack of Input Validation**: The registration form does not validate user inputs, leading to
   potential
   security vulnerabilities and data integrity issues.
2. **Missing Password Strength Check**: There is no mechanism to ensure that passwords meet
   minimum strength requirements.
3. **No Form Validation Before Submission**: The form can be submitted without validating the
   fields, allowing empty or invalid data to be processed.
4. **Absence of Tests**: There are no unit or widget tests to verify the functionality of the form
   and its validation logic.

| ID | Issue Description                                         | Severity | Status |
|----|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|
| 1  | Email validation accepts invalid emails like `a@` or `@b` | High     | Fixed  |
| 2  | Password validation completely missing                    | High     | Fixed  |
| 3  | Form submits successfully with empty/invalid fields       | Critical | Fixed  |
| 4  | No widget or unit tests for validation                    | Medium   | Fixed  |

## ‚úÖ Solution

To address the identified issues, the following solutions were implemented:

1. **Input Validation**: Implemented validation logic for email and password fields to ensure
   correct formats and strength.
2. **Password Strength Check**: Added a password strength checker to enforce minimum requirements.
3. **Form Validation**: Ensured that the form cannot be submitted unless all fields are valid.
4. **Testing**: Created unit and widget tests to verify the functionality of the form and its
   validation logic.

## üß™ Tests Summary

A comprehensive suite of tests was created to ensure the robustness of the registration form. The
tests cover various scenarios, including valid and invalid inputs, password strength checks, and
form submission behavior.

| Type         | Description                                 | Status   |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|----------|
| Unit Tests   | Validate text form fields validation logic  | ‚úÖ Passed |
| Widget Tests | Check form errors and successful submission | ‚úÖ Passed |
