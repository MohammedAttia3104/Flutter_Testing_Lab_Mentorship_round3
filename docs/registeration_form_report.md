  Expected: Rejected ‚ùå

- **Evidence:**  
  Input: `"1234"` ‚Üí Accepted ‚úÖ  
  Expected: Should require uppercase, number, special char ‚ùå

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Missing Form Validation Before Submission

- **Cause:** No `_formKey.currentState!.validate()` call before submit.

- **Evidence:** Console log showed "Form submitted" even when fields were blank.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Missing Tests

- **Cause:** No coverage for validation logic or form behavior.
